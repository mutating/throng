Sometimes our programs need to execute console commands. In some cases, a command may be executed locally, while in others it may be executed in parallel across thousands of machines in the cloud. This library serves as an abstraction layer over various command execution environments, allowing you to write code once that will run anywhere. Specific execution environments are connected here as plugins (and you can even write your own!) with a unified API, and your code doesn’t need to know the internal workings of a specific plugin to run commands within it.

This library provides:

- Complete isolation of the program’s core logic from where and how commands are executed. The logic remains compact and describes the essence of the problem.
- The ability to easily swap one implementation for another. For example, you can replace local command execution with execution inside a Docker container or a cloud virtual machine without changing the code.
- Parallelization is simple. Each plugin decides for itself what level of parallelism it needs, so the main code doesn’t even need to know that it’s running in parallel.
